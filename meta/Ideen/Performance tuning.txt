- chunk culling
- client side physics interpolation
- Determine float tesslevel on CPU. Recalculate first order chunk when spaceship moves x. Recalcualte second order chunk when spaceship moves 2x...
	- if tesslevel = 10,5 that means:
		you have 16 subdivisions (round up next 2^x)
		you multiply the effect of the lates subdivision with 
			(tesslevel - (round down 2^x)) / (round down 2^x))
